My project is a web app named Kaya Online Store. It makes use of php, html, css and Bootstrap. I have been working on the project for a long time and modified it to use bootstrap
The project repository: https://github.com/FatimaHAbubakar/implementation191212017.git
The bootstrap and website template were obtained from https://www.w3schools.com/ , it is shown in the repository.


I was working on another web app named Dear,  implemented using react javascript, and css. It makes use of react and react router. But it proved challenging, The project does not have a template but was developed based on a react tutorial youtube video.
